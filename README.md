# Otter-Productions
Team Project for CS 461/462

This Project is one that we have done for the Senior Capstone Project at Western Oregon University. Events for change is an application for people who need assistance when it comes to food, housing, access to clean water, and other necessities in life. The idea behind it is that it can be a central place for people to find free events that organizations are putting on like events where people can get things like free food, water, clothing, shelter, or toiletries.
